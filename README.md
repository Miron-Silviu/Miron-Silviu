 # ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m Silviu 
 
 A front-end developer passionate about building beautiful, user-friendly websites and applications. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring frameworks like React, Bootstrap and Tailwind.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning by creating projects that challenge me, from responsive landing pages to interactive web apps. Every line of code brings me closer to mastering the art of front-end development.

âœ¨ I believe in continuous growth and am always eager to learn new technologies and best practices in web development. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me sketching design ideas, reading tech blogs, or experimenting with creative layouts.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s connect! Feel free to check out my projects, share feedback, or collaborate on open-source initiatives.
